# DSA Journey » From Zero ➤ Hero  
## GitHub: RAGHURAMOFFICIAL07  
» About This Repository

This repository is a personal learning archive — a detailed record of my journey to master Data Structures & Algorithms from absolute zero.
No pre-built foundation. No shortcut templates. Just pure commitment to becoming a strong problem solver.

» Why This Exists

To document my growth from DSA beginner to DSA confident
To make structured learning a habit, not a phase
To serve as a digital second brain for future revision
To prove that consistent practice beats overnight genius
This is not a crash course. It’s not curated by a mentor.
It’s a self-built roadmap, updated in real-time — filled with solved problems, rough notes, raw logic, and clarity earned through repetition.

» What You'll Find Inside

Section Name	Description
TopicLogs/	Topic-wise DSA breakdowns and code walkthroughs
Solutions/	Platform problems with explained logic and edge cases
Notes/	Beginner-focused conceptual notes and visuals
QuickSheets.md	My concise cheatsheets built from repeated learning
Progress.md	Transparent tracker of wins, blocks, and goals

» Intended Audience

If you're:

Starting DSA from scratch,
Struggling to stay consistent,
Or looking for a structured, real-world learner's repo—
This space is for you.

» Closing Note

DSA is not a destination. It's a skillset.
This repo is where I sharpen that skill — one structure, one solution, and one solved doubt at a time.
